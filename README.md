        	UNIQUE-
        	The perfect functioning of GUI which is similar to any other search engine .Flipkart's GUI page consists of the product image , name , price , rating and highlights. You can search for any product like phone , tv , ac , laptop , furniture , accessories , groceries , etc..
        	 I have displayed the details in separate pages . GUI is friendly because of the  proper functionality of the button click. I have tried to display the maximum details of products on flipkart's GUI page .I have made a folder named “demo” which has various  screenshots of the functionality of this project .
 
 
        	PROBLEMS FACED -
 
        	Firstly I started working on pycharm(professional version), but it didn't work properly .The major problem faced while making this project was  getting errors . Extraction of product image was very difficult for products like books , groceries ,etc. I could not scrap the amazon website because of an access problem.
 
 
 
        	SCOPE OF IMPROVEMENT -

        	The additional features that can be added to this project is including more websites like snapdeal , shopclues ,paytmmall, etc...
        	Currently I have not included these websites because of lack of major products like oneplus phones , apple iphones and many more.
 
 
        	WHAT DID I LEARN FROM THIS PROJECT -
        	I have learned python from scrap . I learned about the various python packages . This project taught me how to debug and then handle the errors.The most important thing that I learned is time management and proper planning that is required to make a project .
